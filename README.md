# PyGameUI

Python library that makes making pygame-based-UIs easy!

## Short overview

PygameUI is a small Python library written in Python that makes it easier to make UI elements like buttons, texts, inputs, and more when using the Python library PyGame. The library does also supply the user with lots of optional features for customizing the UI elements. PyGameUI is not that efficient, so I would not use it on larger games (not that most people would make large games in Python), but if you are looking for a library that makes small projects and games a lot less of a headache, I would defiantly recommend you give PygameUI a try!
